# SVELive-Android
This project demonstrates the use of the [Express Lanes API](https://github.com/vta/expresslanes-api) in an Android application.

[EventBus](http://greenrobot.org/eventbus/) is being used to provide a stable method for passing data beween the [socket.io native client](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-java) and the UI on the main thread.
